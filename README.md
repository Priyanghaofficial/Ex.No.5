# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

## NAME :priyangha g
## REG NO. : 212223040157

## Aim  
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- ChatGPT (or any other LLM tool)

---

## Explanation  

Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

## Output  

### Comparative Table of Naïve vs. Basic Prompts  

| **Scenario** | **Naïve Prompt** | **Response (Naïve)** | **Basic Prompt** | **Response (Basic)** | **Comparison (Quality, Accuracy, Depth)** |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Creative Story** | "Write a story about a dragon." | *"Once upon a time, a dragon lived in a cave. People were afraid of it, but one day it became friendly."* | "Write a 300-word story about a dragon who protects a village, including themes of bravery and sacrifice." | *"The dragon Arion guarded the mountain village from invaders. Though feared at first, he sacrificed his safety to save the villagers, earning their love and respect..."* | Basic prompt produces richer characters, themes, and emotional depth. |
| **Factual Q&A** | "Tell me about AI." | *"AI is artificial intelligence. It means machines that can think and learn. It is used in robots and computers."* | "Explain Artificial Intelligence in 200 words, covering definition, applications, and real-world examples." | *"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. Applications include chatbots, medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, and fraud detection in banking..."* | Basic prompt provides better **accuracy** and **clarity**. |
| **Summarization** | "Summarize climate change." | *"Climate change is when the Earth gets hotter. Ice melts, sea levels rise, and weather changes."* | "Summarize climate change in under 150 words, focusing on causes, effects, and solutions." | *"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather. Causes include greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Effects are rising sea levels, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. Solutions include renewable energy, afforestation, and sustainable policies."* | Basic prompt improves **clarity, relevance, and depth balance**. |
| **Advice / Recommendation** | "Give me some career advice." | *"You should work hard, learn new skills, and never give up."* | "Give me career advice as a computer science graduate in India, focusing on AI/ML opportunities." | *"As a CS graduate in India, focus on Python, TensorFlow, and data science tools. Build projects in AI/ML, join hackathons, and contribute to open-source. Explore careers in fintech, healthcare AI, and startups where demand for AI talent is high."* | Basic prompt gives **practical, tailored, and useful** advice. |

### Analysis  

1. **Quality**  
   - Naïve prompts: Produced generic, vague responses.  
   - Basic prompts: Generated structured, meaningful, and engaging content.  

2. **Accuracy**  
   - Naïve prompts: Often incomplete, lacking details.  
   - Basic prompts: Factually stronger and more relevant due to explicit context.  

3. **Depth**  
   - Naïve prompts: Surface-level, repetitive, lacking nuance.  
   - Basic prompts: Provided deeper insights, examples, and actionable guidance.  

4. **Special Case**  
   - In creative tasks, naïve prompts gave acceptable results, but structured prompts made content more coherent and reader-friendly.

### Summary of Findings  

- Prompt clarity has a **direct impact** on the quality of AI-generated content.  
- **Basic (structured) prompts consistently outperform naïve prompts** in quality, accuracy, and depth.  
- Naïve prompts only work decently in broad creative contexts but still lack refinement.  
- For best results, prompts should include **context, constraints, and specific instructions** (e.g., word limits, themes, perspectives).
